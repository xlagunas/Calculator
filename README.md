# Calculator [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/xlagunas/Calculator/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/xlagunas/Calculator/tree/master)

This is a small test project containing an add/substract only calculator.

It supports device rotation and operation chaining (use previous operation's result for the next operation) 
and keeps track of all the operations being made (popped out when the user presses the back button). 

It is bundled with both Espresso tests and JUnit tests.
And also it's integrated in a CI environment (initially was Travis, later on has been moved to circleCI)
